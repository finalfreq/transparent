This is probably the most concise version out there.

-  [@mdo](http://codeguide.co/)

It references in good part these other more robust and slightly more opinionated standards

-  [Idiomatic](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
-  [Github Style Guides](https://github.com/styleguide) - [Guidelines](http://primercss.io/guidelines/)


This one's got some good javascript pointers as well, stylesheet stuff is mostly covered in the above

Specifically Sass, this one is Veeeeeerbose but lotsa good stuff if you want to dip into the power of Sass via best practices
