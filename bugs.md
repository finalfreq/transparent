Bug tracking at Revelation:

- Waffle stories shouldn’t be finished if there are known bugs with the features
- If a bug is discovered after a feature has been rolled out in master, a new story should be created with the following information:
o The bug label
o What OS and device you are using
o How to reproduce the bug – this should be whittled down to as few steps as possible. Note if the bug is seen always or just sometimes.
o What you expected to see
o What you saw instead
- The bug should be prioritized in Waffle by either assigning to someone or put in the backlog.
